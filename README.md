Copilot Summary
===============
The current code includes:

 - Federal tax information for different filing statuses.
 - State tax information for multiple states, including deductions, exemptions, and tax tables.
 - Handles different sources of retirement income (e.g., pensions, social security, retirement accounts).
 - Calculates the tax impact of these income sources.
 - Suggests portfolio allocation for retirement.

My Summary
==========
Estimates taxes across states for retirement relocation tradeoffs

Needs *a lot* of work, and I don't doubt it has bugs.

It matches professional tax software result for my specific tax situation but might not for you.
